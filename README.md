# Mini Shell
 This project implements a Mini Shell, a simplified version of a Unix-like shell, built using C++, Lex, and Yacc. It supports command execution, input/output redirection, piping, background processes, signal handling, and wildcard expansion. The shell is developed incrementally through a structured approach, enhancing both parsing and process management functionalities.
